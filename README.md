# Battleship Game (TDD Project)

This is my Battleship game project in The Odin Project.

The main goal is to practice **Test Driven Development (TDD)** using **Jest**, and also to write clean, modular JavaScript code before connecting it to the DOM.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Learn and practice Test Driven Development.
- Build a simple version of the classic Battleship game.
- Separate the game logic from the user interface.
- Understand how to write unit tests for JavaScript classes and functions.

## ðŸ§© Features

- Ship objects that can be hit and sunk.
- Gameboard that handles ship placement and attacks.
